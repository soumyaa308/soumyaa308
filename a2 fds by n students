Write a python program to store marks scored in the subject "fundamental of Data Structure" by n students in the
class.Write functions to compute following:
     (a)The average score of the class
     (b)Highest and lowest score of the class.
     (c)Count of students who were absent for the test.
     (d)Display marks with highest frequency.
